Will's Text Adventure is meant to be a simple Infocom-like text adventure
game.  I'm writing it as an exercise in learning to program in Clojure.

## Usage

The game is a simple console application.  To build and run it:

1. Install the latest version of Leiningen.
2. In the project root directory, enter

    lein run
